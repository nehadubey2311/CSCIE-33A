## Notes:
* Style for JavaScript doc commenting has been taken from:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc#Structure_of_a_Javadoc_comment
    
* Tried changing timezone for mail app in 'settings.py' file via 'TIME_ZONE' but still correct timezone is not being reflected. Couldn't find a resolution.
